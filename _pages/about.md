I am a financial econometrician in the [Department of Economics](https://www.econ.cuhk.edu.hk/en/home/) at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html). My work focuses on high-frequency (intraday) market data: developing robust volatility estimators, designing informative liquidity measures, and linking microstructure dynamics to asset pricing and broader macro-financial relationships.
